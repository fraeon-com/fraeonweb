                        No Man's Sky finally has a release date and I can’t wait to start exploring the 
                        universe that the team over at Hello Games has set in motion. To get ready for 
                        the launch of one of the most anticipated games of the last few years we’ll be 
                        taking a closer look at everything No Man’s Sky has in store for us.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      While there has been tons of coverage for the title during it’s development Sean Murray, 
                      the creator of No Man’s Sky, and his team over at Hello Games have been keeping quiet 
                      about most details about the game. As Murray has explained they would rather have people 
                      experience the game and all its secrets than find everything out before they’ve had a 
                      chance to play. However there is a lot to learn from the many articles, videos, and 
                      interviews around the web and we’ll be pouring through them to find every secret they hold.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Starting with the basics though, No Man’s Sky is a space sim/exploration/survival game set 
                      in a huge procedurally generated sci-fi universe with over 18 quintillion planets, each of 
                      which you can fly to in your own spaceship, land on the surface and explore every open field, 
                      mountain, river, ocean, cave, and forest. All the while discovering and naming new creatures, 
                      finding alien relics, stumbling into alien cities and learning their languages. As you take 
                      to the stars you’ll encounter pirates, be caught up in massive space battles between huge 
                      fleets, meet friendly traders, or simply drift alone through seemingly endless open space. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      No Man’s Sky will have multiplayer of some kind and all players will be in the universe 
                      together but everyone will be quite spread out when they start so it’s not likely you’ll be 
                      running into anyone early in the game. Hello Games has been a bit vague as to how exactly 
                      multiplayer will work so while it’s widely assumed that you’ll starting running into more 
                      players as you get closer to the center of the universe it’s not quite clear if that will be 
                      the case. If you aren’t worried about finding the mysterious center then it’s quite likely 
                      that you’ll never see another player as long as you play the game considering the sheer size 
                      of the universe.

                        The focus of this game is exploration, so there is no campaign to complete. There isn’t even 
                        a way to “win” in No Man’s Sky, only the never-ending universe to be explored. However that’s 
                        not to say there is no story.  Murray has continued to tease an overarching mystery, centered 
                        around the Atlas, which is the object we’ve seen in the games logo, and an antagonist of sorts 
                        that he calls “a malevolent force” as well as whatever lies at the fabled center of the universe. 
                        But even more than that there is a reason for your characters existence, why you’re there 
                        exploring the stars and tales of those that came before you, but the game isn’t going to just tell 
                        you this. You’ll have to search for it, finding clues and unraveling mysteries as you make your way 
                        through the expanse.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Of course exploration and survival require supplies and equipment though, as well as a capable 
                        ship for interstellar. That’s something that you’ll learn immediately since you’ll start on a 
                        planet with only a “lifepod” ship with no hyperdrive and some basic necessities. From there you’ll 
                        need to explore and gather resources to scrape together enough Units (the currency in No Man’s Sky) 
                        to purchase a ship of your own to begin exploring the universe. The basic equipment you’ll start 
                        out with is your suit and your multitool. Your suit provides protection from the elements, whether 
                        its acid rain or extreme cold, breathe underwater, and also do away with pesky gravity so that 
                        you’re not floating away with every step on some planets or getting crushed by your own weight on 
                        others. Your multitool does (big surprise here) multiple things, from a weapon (in case alien 
                        creatures get hostile), to a scanner, to a mining tool to extract resources. Murray has compared 
                        it to a Tricorder but sounds to me like a Tricorder strapped to a Phaser rifle, not that I’m 
                        complaining. You can also equip your character with a jetpack, but it appears you’ll have purchase 
                        one from a trading post before you start to flying to all those places that were just out of reach 
                        before. Your characters equipment can also be upgraded but only at trading posts on planets (this 
                        applies only to your personal equipment, not ship upgrades) so your suit could better protect your 
                        from the weather or you could upgrade your multitools mining capabilities. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Ships come in three classes Explorers, Fighters and Traders. Though it’s pretty self explanatory as 
                      to what each class of ship is for they won’t actually be labeled as a specific class. Instead each 
                      class will have specific enhancements suited for their individual role and these will give indication 
                      of what type of ship it is. Each ship will have between 1 to 3 of these enhancements and each of 
                      these can be upgraded to improve the performance of that component. For example fighters will be 
                      lighter, faster and more agile while traders will be slower and larger but their weapons will pack 
                      more of a punch. Exploration ships will have better stealth capabilities and more efficient 
                      hyperdrives to help them lay low and avoid (or run from) a fight which will be important since if 
                      you die, all the exploration data and resources you’ve collected since your last upload to the Atlas. 
                      That being said having your ship destroyed won’t necessarily cause you to meet an untimely demise, 
                      the ships cockpit is a lifepod like the one you start out with, so while you’ll have lost your ship 
                      and all it’s upgrades you can head down to a planet and start earning some Units for a new ride 
                      (and mourn the loss of your old one).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Buying and trading are done at outposts that you might come across while planetside or at space 
                      stations, which are quite common through out space (there are even some claims that these will 
                      be found in each system but that seems quite unlikely and I haven’t been able to find an official 
                      source for this).  Units can be earned several ways such as uploading exploration data to the Atlas’
                      database from beacons found on planets, or by trading (if that wasn’t obvious already) as mentioned 
                      earlier and can be used to buy new ships or to upgrade your current one and to refuel your ship if 
                      you don’t feel like mining resources to refuel it yourself. 
                    </p>

                      There is quite a lot more to No Man’s Sky and we’ll be looking closer at each aspect of the game in 
                      the coming weeks before launch. If you want to know more about No Man’s Sky you should check out the 
                      official website <a href="http://www.no-mans-sky.com/">www.no-mans-sky.com</a> and stay tuned for the next part of this series where we’ll be 
                      taking a closer look at the spaceships of No Man’s Sky. You can also let let us know what part of
